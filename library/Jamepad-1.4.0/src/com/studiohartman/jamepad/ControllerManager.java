/**
 * This class handles initializing the native library, connecting to controllers, and managing the
 * list of controllers.
 *
 * Generally, after creating a ControllerManager object and calling initSDLGamepad() on it, you
 * would access the states of the attached gamepads by calling getState().
 *
 * For some applications (but probably very few), getState may have a performance impact. In this
 * case, it may make sense to use the getControllerIndex() method to access the objects used
 * internally by  ControllerManager.
