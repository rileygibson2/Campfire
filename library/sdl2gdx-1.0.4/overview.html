<h1>Java SDL - GDX Controllers</h1>
<p>This library provides APIs at three layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Java wrapper around SDL.  Currently we wrap most of Joystick and GameController.  PRs to wrap further APIs are welcome.  This wrapper is as close to the C source as
possible, so you should be able to port any SDL examples with no changes.
<li>An OO wrapper on top of layer 1.  The same functions as provided by SDL, but with a class based API to make them more friendly to use.
<li>An implementation of LibGDX Controller API on top of layer 2.  You can slot this straight in to any LibGDX app, or you can use it directly in a non-LibGDX app.
</ol>
